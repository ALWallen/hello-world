Hi Humans!

Alex here, I wish to learn more about how I could just coding to be more effective in the workplace. Additionally, coding just seems
miraculous from the outside looking in. :p I hope to learn how to automate processes on the computer, especially some of the more
repetitive tasks, so I forgo blowing my brains out. Excited to learn some of the tutorials!
